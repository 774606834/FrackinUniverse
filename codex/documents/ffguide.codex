"This guide will brief you on what you need to know to play with Frackin' Universe effectively. You need to keep in mind that a lot of the default play of Starbound has been altered by many aspects of the mod. \n
^#555555;--------------------------------------------------^reset;
^green;The Tricorder - Your Best Friend: ^white;\n\nThis device is the singlemost useful item in your inventory at any time. It provices access to the ^orange;Research System^reset;, along with numerous other functions accessed via the icons on screen. In addition, it has an alternate and tertiary functions with the Right mouse button or Shift + Click\n

^cyan;Research? What do you mean, Research?^reset;
--------------------------------------
\n
FrackinUniverse now introduces a progression overhaul we've called the ^orange;Research System^reset;. Accessed through your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, ^orange;SAIL Computer^reset; or ^orange;Quickbar^reset; , it is the sole means by which you learn new blueprints for crafting. To unlock new blueprints you'll need resources as well as the important currency known as ^green;Research^reset;.\n
Through this system, you'll be able to custom-tailor the new unlocks you want and in the order you choose to pursue them.\n

You gain ^green;Research^reset; at a rate of 1 every 2 seconds, passively, as long as you are playing. You can also gain ^green;Research^reset; through other means, including ^cyan;Laptops and Data Centers^reset;. In short, play and experiment and you'll get all the research you need. ^red;NOTE: You cannot gain passive research while AFK^reset;. 

^cyan;Combat^reset;
---------------------
See FU Guide: Battle

^cyan;Mechs^reset;
-------------------
Mechs are not the same as you're used to in Starbound. They now ^red;require fuel^reset;, and can be refueled with many types. In addition, they have separate Health from their Fuel/Energy bar. The end result is a much more useful vehicle that can extend mining trips and greatly improve survivability in harsh environments.

Mechs now ^green;calculate their Mass^reset;. ^cyan;Heavier^reset; mechs are able to ^green;stomp and do massive damage^reset; to the ground as well as having better armor. ^cyan;Light^reset; mechs are ^green;much faster^reset; and have vastly ^green;improved fuel efficiency^reset;.

Your mech can ^green;Sprint^reset; by double-tapping ^cyan;A^reset; or ^cyan;D^reset;.

Your mech can switch to ^green;Flight Mode^reset; by double-tapping ^cyan;W^reset;.

There are dozens of new types of mech part, including Mech Modules. These act like Augments for your Mech and can allow a great amount of customization. There's a mech part for your playstyle.

Refuel or Re-equip your mech through your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;.


^cyan;Status Effects^reset;
-----------------------
FrackinUniverse adds a ^green;great number^reset; of new Status Effects, beneficial and harmful, that can affect characters and monsters alike. Most can be resisted or ignored with the proper equipment. Part of the experienec is learning how to survive in new environments, and strategizing your ^green;Research^reset; around it.


^cyan;Madness^reset;
--------------------
Another form of currency in FrackinUniverse. It can be gained from many actions (most commonly the bizarre or terrifying) but will also fade away with time. The more ^#e43774;Madness^reset; you possess, the greater the negative effects you experience. Spending your ^#e43774;Madness^reset; through powerful ^green;Research^reset; in ^orange;Metaphysics^reset;, ^orange;Ship Counseller Crew^reset; or ^orange;Instafreud^reset; machines are all reliable ways to reduce ^#e43774;Madness^reset; in a hurry.

Carrying around terrifying things in your bag can also result in gaining ^#e43774;Madness^reset; over time. Pay attention if SAIL warns you of this.

There are more than 50 possible effects of ^#e43774;Madness^reset;.


^cyan;Genes^reset;
-----------------
This currency replaced the ^red;33 separate Gene items^reset; used from 2014-2020. Now, a singular form of ^green;Gene^reset; is used, making tracking your totals much easier and giving you more than 30 less resources to store.

^green;Genes^reset; are used for ^orange;Agriculture^reset; and ^orange;Genetics^reset;.


^cyan;BYOS (Build your own Ship)^reset;
-----------------------------
In FrackinUniverse, you can create your own ship from the ground up. This system means you no longer need to purchase Ship Upgrades, as any expansion is done by yourself. You'll also need to craft your own engines and will be able to craft special equipment to benefit your ship.
Note that if you select BYOS mode at character creation, this choice is permanent.

At Character Creation, you can select ^cyan;Frackin Ship^reset; or ^cyan;Vanilla Ship^reset;. The Frackin Ship is the BYOS option. Once you make this choice, you're given options for starting ship configurations. Once they make this choice, they begin play like usual.

Crew use special rules on these ships:

You can use ^orange;Crew Deeds^reset;, which follow the same rules as ^orange;Colony Deeds^reset; (Walls, Door, Lights, Bed) ^red;\n\n-or-\n\n^reset; you can opt to use ^orange;Crew Beds^reset; if quick-and-dirty with little planning is more your style. 

You can ^red;not^reset; use both a ^orange;Crew Deed^reset; and ^orange;Crew Bed^reset; together in the same room.

There is a hard-cap of 12 crew. Mods that increase crew limits likely will not operate properly with BYOS.



^cyan;Swimming^reset;
-----------------------
Swimming operates differently than you're used to. Now, you control yourself in water using ^cyan;W A S^reset; and ^cyan;D^reset;. To jump out of the water, hold ^cyan;W^reset; and press ^cyan;Spacebar^reset;. It will take you a few tries to get used to it, but the end result is a much easier control experience.

Note that not all liquids provide buoyancy like water or other similar fluids. In this liquids and gases physics can behave quite different than expected."
