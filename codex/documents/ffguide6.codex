		"FrackinUniverse adds a large amount of armor and enhances some older ones, allowing for a greater variety of playstyles. While playing with various armors, you may notice they have a very wide range of stats, bonuses and terms that might make no sense. Try not to be overwhelmed, these can be very useful later!",
		"Stats: Armor can have a wide range. Vanilla players may notice there are more than they are used to, and even the ones they are used to have different ranges than they are used to! FU presents a wider variety of armor classes to spice up your play.(next)",
		"If you are more interested in damage, pick up power armor or hyper power armor to trade defensive stats for offensive ones. Alternatively, pick up tank or power tank sets to outlast your enemy. They come in melee OR ranged! Fighting not quite your thing? Pick up an exploration oriented set, and be at home in your environment! Oh, and...charisma is a thing. Purely for trading at space stations. Better deals!",
		"Resistances: Many armors in FU come with inherent resistances. Many biome weather effects will simply stop affecting you once you hit an appropriate amount, and various enemy attacks will do less damage. Nifty, right? It gets better; upgrade your armor, and those resistances will increase!",
		"Bonuses: Most are increases to your stats, plenty are conditional. Any that say +thing are additive increases. If it gives +3% Crit Chance, that increases your base crit chance. If it says it gives More of something, that's a multiplier after the fact. Have 1000% Damage somehow? 100% More would make it 2000%! Small note: Regen is per second.(next)",
		"Of course, some bonuses have hidden components we couldn't easily include, for tooltip space. Mining laser sets grant a lot more damage...but that bonus is reduced significantly if you are pairing them with something else. Using a mining laser with a pistol, as example: 100% More Mining Laser Damage becomes 25%. (next)",
		"Additionally, there are some other phrase uses to note. If a set bonus states that it grants immunity to ALL of a related effect, that typically means all biome weather as well as specific status effects related to that element. For heat, that includes burning and even lava! For radiation, that includes rad-burn. (next)",
		"As a small side-note, some terms or symbols are used loosely. If you see a weapon bonus with 1/2, that means the bonuses are different based on number of weapons of the type are equipped.",
		"Special Bonuses: Some sets have special bonuses that don't really display much information due to lack of space, an unfortunate limitation of the game. Here, some bonuses will be explained. But first, COLORS! Colors are important in set bonuses. If something is GREEN, that means it is a good thing. RED means it is a bad thing. Cyan is for things that are binary. They typically do not stack with similar effects. (next)",
		"Auto-Medic: More complicated than straight regen, this effect will restore more health per second at the cost of an equal percentage of energy. Thorns: a nova of thorns when hit. Summons Minions: usually conditional, summons buddies to fight alongside or distract. Life/Energy Shell: Gain damage absorbtion based on your resources to protect your health. Regenerates quickly if you haven't taken damage recently.(next)",
		"Gravity Normalization: Personal gravity too low? Ip it goes. Too high? Down instead. Exception: Zero-gravity."
