______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 6.0.132 ^reset;

  -- BYOS --
  *  you can change some stuff about your Ship Pet from one of the Options in the [MISC] section of the SAIL menu (e.g. if you you interact with it or not)

  -- Reseach --
  * Gold Circuitry node requires less resources
  * Item Utilities node requires less resources and Research (1000 -> 800)
  * Graphene node in Chemistry reduced from 2700 to 2000 Research
  * Morphite reduced from 7200 to 5000 Research
  * Drastically reduced many Armor and Weapons node costs

  -- Madness --
  * minor adjustments to madness quest script:
   - 'food' drain event removes and may randomly reapply well-fed bonus. food randomizer instead randomizes energy on casual. This makes them more relevant for casual players.
   - replaced application of medical station toxic cloud with a madness specific variant. additionally, added a minor slow and a beans related message.
   - replaced usage of staffslow2 and slow with madness specific slows of reduced effectiveness. staffslow2 could be cheesed using heavy weapons anyway.
   - corrected flipped conditions in research bonus by tier, resulting in a bonus never applying for staying more than 25 minutes on a high tier planet.
   - max food reduction effect instead applies the gas cloud and slow effects for casual players.
   - added an alarming radio message when vulnerability is applied.
   - added a harmless message to the >1500 bracket, purely to confuse people further.
  * Crown of the Idiot: now applies a stacking healingBonus modifier of -0.5 per interval, stacking up to -2.0 (effectively negating any and all healingBonus increases), to mitigate AFK cheese by making the target decidedly...mortal.

  -- Misc --
  * Combustion Generator now uses Advanced Processor, rather than Advanced Circuit, in its recipe
  * Made chainsaw cool
  * Rock Crusher processes more stone types

  -- Bugs --
  * tutorial quest: moved setStage(1) from init to questStart, to prevent quest restarting on leaving worlds etc.
  * Fixed colony stuff crashing due to unexpected reactions to Khe's transferutil changes. Added sanity checks.
  * Doom Trees no longer drop Research
  * dozens of minor corrections and fixes
  * Corrected Protheon output from the Protheon Shard via microscopes

	"welcome" : "
Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.
