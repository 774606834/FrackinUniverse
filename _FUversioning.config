  ^cyan;New in version 6.0.0^reset;
  
  ^orange;-- The Research Update (at long last!) --^reset;
  
  After four years of planning and biding time, the Research System is *finally* here. There will most -certainly- be bumps along the way, but as usual we'll hone things as we go. This is a MASSIVE update. You would be wise to read all of the information being provided.
  
  We highly recommend a NEW universe and NEW character for this update, but it is not strictly necessary. 


  ^yellow;The Big Changes^reset;

  - ^red;ALL^reset; unlocks for crafting are now handled by ^green;Researching on the Research Tree^reset;. This -includes- vanilla progression. 
  - You can access the ^orange;Research Tree^reset; via your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, which all new characters now begin with. 
  - Users with ^orange;Quickbar^reset; installed will be able to use that as well. In addition to this, you can use ^orange;SAIL^reset; in the ^green;[MISC]^reset; section.
  - All players now ^green;passively gain research^reset; at a rate of 1 per 2 seconds.
  - ^red;This amount only accrues if you are not AFK.^reset;
  - A huge amount of info has been added to the Codex Guides for FU, and they have their own section in the Codex menu of the Tricorder
  
  The following research branches are now available: Electronics, Engineering, Agriculture, Chemistry, Craftsmanship, Geology, Warcraft. 

  You'll find all the recipes within, and will need to manually unlock nodes to learn recipes. This means no more pickup lag from unlocks! If we missed any, please let us know!

  ^yellow;-- NEW! BYOS and Ships -- (Hubnester and Skies)^reset;
  * Made the ship selection interface more like the FU SAIL interface
  * Removed the wait before selecting which ship you choose (replaced by having to confirm your selection)
  * You can't access ship navigation if you are not on your own ship (unless in admin mode)
  * You can always access ship navigation when in admin mode
  * Reduced the health of sloped rusty panels to match the health of sloped hull panels
  * Added a ship name plate (only the ships owner can name the ship, break the one used to name the ship to reset the name) (Skies)
  * Added the ship name plate to the Ship Crafting node of the engineering research tree
  * Changed it so that techstations check if the world type is unknown instead of if ship.fuel is not nil for checking if on a ship to fix an issue with T0 ships
  * Changed the broken SAIL on the BYOS ship to the BYOS SAIL without a pet
  * Made it so that the ship select interface appears on ships that haven't been replaced with the BYOS ship (though you can only select the vanilla ship)
  * Moved some BYOS related files
  * Big changes to Racializer: 
    - Replaced UI (Skies)
    - Now requires pixels to racialise things (can reduce the price by adding PGIs) (Skies)
    - Takes time to racialise the object (Skies)
    - You can break the old racialiser to get the new one (Skies)
    - You can racialise non-byos ship objects (converts them to the byos version) (Skies)
  * Changed Skath's title in the species file from SKATH to Skath (shouldn't do anything except make it work better with the new racialiser) (Hubnester)
  * Changed the script for the bootship quest (to prevent mods form overriding the changes for BYOS) (Hubnester)
  * Implemented the ability to only travel in the current system better (is currently unused) (Hubnester)
  * Made the NAVIGATION OFFLINE and FTL DRIVE NOT INSTALLED text config parameters in cockpit.config (Hubnester)

  * Your ship pet is set to the race you selected, not the race the ship is racialised to
  * You get teleported to your ship teleporter when your chosen ship is placed  
  * NOTE: starter treasure in choosable BYOS ship could be in any container with enough space for it that isn't a fuel hatch

  ^yellow;-- NEW ! Automatic Colony System (anoobindisguise) ----^reset;
  * A Colony Core which collects rent passively from mk2 deeds, and supports 1 of each of 11 addons. The more happiness tenants have from add-ons, the more rent is collected.
  * added Colony Core, Mk2 Deed, Tiny Mk2 Deed
  * Sewage Storage (generates waste from tenants), community library (no power cost, happiness), 
  * Community Garden (growing tray that has speed multiplied by tenants)

  * Recycling Center (generates recyclables from tenants), 
  * Computer Lab (requires power, provides happiness)

  * Drug Diffuser (generates research and madness from tenants, big happiness penalty), 
  * FTL Internet Dish (requires a lot of power, provides a lot of happiness)

  ^yellow;-- Crafting --^reset;

  * all 33 Gene items have been ^red;removed as resources^reset; and ^green;replaced with a singular 'Genes' currency^reset;. (Kukagres)

  * All vanilla racial armors have set bonuses, as do the Silver, Gold, etc sets and the Perfect set.

  * research extracted is currently 1% of pixel value per tier, with the precursor box having a bonus: 10% of the research extracted as essence
  * the timer, and extraction values, go up further with rarity (0.25 per tier, starting at 1.0), with essential being equal to legendary at 1.75 (decision due to upgraded weapons). however, if an item has a value of 1 or less research, the value is set to 1 and the timer is multiplied by 0.1

  ^yellow;-- Madness --^reset;
  * Edited Madness Tree: Added Rimworlder clothes to the first node (alongside Autopsy table)

  * mech fuel UI no longer truncates current fuel values (Kherae)
  * cat themed fuel is usable again for refueling mech. (Kherae)
  * mech fuel system now supports going over the maximum by the value of one fuel item. IE: cat fuel at max-1 will become catfuel + max-1. Words are tricky. In short: fuel is never wasted. (Kherae)

  * revised necrontir set pixel values (Kherae)

  * Microscope UI is now more easily worked with, with defined slots for outputs.
  * Solar Panels of all tiers are no longer nerfed on Ships or Space Stations due to the Research method being implemented! Rejoice!

  * fixed crystal block unlock (CyanSkyKnight)

  * magazine augment now properly adds ammo (Kherae)

	"welcome" : "
Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n
