______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.419^reset;

  -- Races --

  * Evil Chefs have dialog
  * Secret entrance to cult ship added

  -- Misc --
  * The Dantalion: the way to get into the secret area has been changed, since the switches in that area would frequently get destroyed by the miniboss. If you wander up to a certain part in that room, Koichi will give you a hint on how to proceed. (Rylasasin)
  * Wraith Set no longer uses the wrong stat for poison immunity, and added unlocks/recipe (Kherae)

  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.418^reset;

  -- Races --
  * Peglaci have had their eyes adjusted to bear a more sinister countenance instead of looking like bubbles.
  * Xi Biomoorphic armor now has the missing rad and acid protections
  * Xi Biomorphic armor recipe adjusted

  -- Misc --
  * Space station Trade Goods are now affected by charisma (Kherae)
  * Harvester Beamgun tooltip now states its alt will not work on Aeroponic or Hydroponic tiles (edward spec)
  * You can now craft clay with your bare hands via dirt + water
  * Hunting Bow, Iron Bow and Tungsten Bow, Iron Dagger and Tungsten Dagger can be upgraded 
  * added fuel amount labeling to several items. (Kherae)
  * Duplicator output throttled to prevent lag (Kherae)
  * Removed the DO NOT USE branch from the research tree since despite the giant 'DO NOT USE' explanation, people keep asking if they can use it.
  * Gave BYOS and FR toggles in sail a different icon (switch) to tell players they are switches. they also state they are toggles. (Kherae)
  * Swim Boost speeds slightly decreased
  * Rice can now grow in deeper water and won't consume the soil moisture.

  * Elder Stone tiles can now be dyed (Green)
  * adjusted item network codex (Kherae)
  * added item network codexes to science outpost library (Kherae)
  
  -- Dungeons --
  * The PNG version of the Cultist Altar has been replaced with a json version that has a randomized spawner. Can spawn a basic, scientist, assault, sniper, or rocket cultist in order from most common to rarist. (Rylasasin)
  * Cultists spawned on the altars, ship, and lair are now tied to the world/instance, rather than spawning with a random level. (Rylasasin)
  * Readjusted space enemy groups so they now use the spawner. Might need further adjustment. Basically, enemy groups are now completely random instead of a bunch of set groups. You never know what you will encounter (nor how many) in any space area now. (Rylasasin)
  * Converted a few microdungeons from my FFS Dungeons and Encounters mod. Namely, the Cultist/Pirate (now bandit) tents, and the Bandit Tower. They have randomized spawners. I don't know how you want to distribute those, so I'll leave that up to you. (Rylasasin)
  * New Space Encounter: Elite Bandit Asteroid Base. Another conversion from my FFS mod, this time a much heavier makeover. They are the same types of FU Bandits that appear on Eden worlds. There's a wrexem boss in the first floor to replace the pirate boss. He's a placeholder until we can come up with another monster/npc to replace him. (Kherae)
  * Removed 'wastelandquests' dungeon from rotation. It no longer serves any purpose since you can get the questgiver's quest from the science outpost. (Rylasasin)

  -- Bugs --
  * space station charisma scaling corrected. 1-Charisma is not the same as Charisma - 1. (Kherae)
  * Can no longer hot-swap queens with identical stats to copy over lifespans (Kherae)
  * adjusted mech fuel UI. it should now properly be available during the tutorial even with certain conflicts installed (Kherae)
  * stranglerootvine no longer crashes. (Kherae)
  * lunari rocket launcher is now properly t2. (Kherae)
  * tiny refinement of foodBase.lua in case of fallback farts. (Kherae)
  * corrected edible neptunium not applying proper food effects (Kherae)
  * sanity checks for some biome patches (Kherae)
  * turning off FR now affects food properly,shutting off bonuses and penalties entirely. FR toggle text updated to reflect this. (Kherae)
  * further fix for npcs dying to bongos, etc., due to vanilla spaghetti (Kherae)
  * Corrected access to a X'i recipe for Uranium Ore
  * Corrected the displayed fuel amount on hydrogen cores. they give 8k, not 5k. (Kherae)
  * reverted hydrogen bomb to using its assigned bomb effect, instead of 'atomsmasherboomyellow' (Kherae)
  * neutron bomb fixed up. should no longer fizzle. does bounce a bit weirdly now. Also gave it tiered 'gravity' ranges, making it marginally more dangerous.  (Kherae)
  * corrected an incorrect path to a moved status effect icon (Kherae)
  * moved 'fuelAmount' from its erroneous placement on the deuterium liquid to the liquid item. (Kherae)

______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.417^reset;

  -- Races --
  * SKATH users: replaced their default ship after the initial ship upgrade , to use the Hylotl ship. This should at least solve your issue of having a 'blank' ship. Sorry for any inconvenience caused.
   
  -- Advanced Liquid Sensor -- 
  (all changes by B-Reif)
  * The sensor now has a single container slot
  * The sensor now has only one wire output, rather than 9
  * The sensors script now compares the liquid at its position to the item placed in its container slot
  * This will break existing setups using this sensor. We apologize for any complications that occur as a result.
  * Through these changes you can now create a liquid router 
  https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12357846/85618358-88911780-b615-11ea-8549-e188c9b58664.png

  -- Duplicator --
  * Rebalanced:
  * No longer uses an internal list of items that can be fuel. now uses fuelAmount property on items. this will result in many former fuels no longer being usable. (Kherae)
  * Fuel input vs item output formula adjusted, no longer has minimum 1 input per fuel. case examples: one d-hydrogen phase core is worth 9-10 densinium bars. it will take several hundred liquid erchius to make one densinium bar (Kherae)
  * Specific fuels on the list (certain unenriched isotopes) are still duplicatable, but at steep penalty. it takes 7 top tier biofuel canisters to make one of the same. (Kherae)
  
  -- Misc --
  * Cultists have leveled loadouts. Might be overbearing, please report if so. (Rylasasin)
  * added a space version of the Wrexor Nar encounter for testing (Rylasasin)
  * Dreamer armor no longer requires protheon shards, and never should have. 
  * Mysterious Parcels will sometimes come into your possession. These contain strange artifacts...
  * moved atmos regenerator status effects from atmos object folder to fu_effects/atmos/ folder (Kherae)
  * Replaced craptastic Regenerator with a better regen variant worth the power use. (Kherae)
  
  -- Bugs --
  * Mech fuel UI fixed up. It will no longer empty the item slot when hitting 'empty fuel', and it will no longer consume fuel when it is full. It will also never consume more than it needs to, fuel more than it can, or waste fuel (Kherae)
  * adjusted ammo system reload saving to be per fire mode, to address weapons being silly about reloading (Kherae)
  * ammo bar will no longer show for single-shot weapons (Kherae)
  * minor script refactor for mage_shield.lua. no longer uses a bar at all.(Kherae)
  * replaced usage of 'stunned.animation' with appropriate per type, in related damage files. (Kherae)
  * fixed several weapons having incomplete animationPart lists for the animations they were using. (Kherae)
  * fixed a typo in an image filename. shadowdenseclowds is now shadowdenseclouds. the unblockable version (unused) now also uses this icon  (Kherae)
  * synced densinium x7 helm description with the other one (Kherae)
  * Corrected some minor issues with the Precursor Converter (Kherae)
  * fixed feebpackcrew statuses (Kherae) 
  * crash case relating to merchants removed, now that the following has been identified and fixed:
several old dungeon files had incorrectly configured merchants, resulting in said merchants voiding themselves and generating errors. (Kherae)

______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.416^reset;

  -- Races --
  * converted various FR racials with 'regen' effects to be percentage based instead of flat amounts  (Kherae)
  * veluu, cat, fenerox: night vision reworked. uses a complex formula involving energy, health, and current health to generate local light. (Kherae)
  * added taurikin and alrune racial data (OromisElf)

  -- Recipes --
  * updated Graphene recipe. It's a bit more 'realistic', rather than rough-hewn approximate.

  -- Monsters --
  * upgraded glitched deathdroid and pet deathdroid firmware (Kherae)

  -- Bees --
  * Young Queens generate rate heavily adjusted. Previously it checked per 100 Production. It now checks every 300. This makes Queen Breed Rate as a stat *much* more valuable.
  * Mite infestation chance increased from 0.005 to 0.01
  * Adjusted most bee stats to be more balanced with less large gaps in capability

  -- Crew --
  * adjusted chef series crewmembers: they now provide -50%, -100%, and -150% hunger drain on the ship, reduced to one third effectiveness when not on a player ship (Kherae)
  -- Effects --
  * gave shadow taint and a related immunity new icons, so they're more easily differentiated from unbreachable darkness (Kherae)
  
  -- Misc --
  * darkvision effect uses fixed strength local light (Kherae)
  * sorted set_bonuses folder into subfolders based on the armor set's location. IE: golden knight and queen in bees folder.

  -- Bugs --
  * corrected unintended reintroduction of immortality bug (Kherae)
  * removed debug code from kraken set. (Kherae)
  * restructured precursor converter frames file. should no longer cause occasional errors. (Kherae)
  * fixed common beam pistol being a lag generator (Kherae)  
  * fixed entropic ward special ability not applying  (Kherae)
  * fixed jelly lump tooltip. doesn't need extra line about half fall damage.  (Kherae)
  * fixed an error in shieldbreaker  (Kherae)
  * added additional checks to gunfire and gunfirefixed to ensure they don't try to play sounds they dont have. (Kherae)
  * added sanity check to runboost
  * added pcall to a function in /scripts/actions/world.lua:interactObjec, so hopefully that wont screech anymore.
  * added check and some debug info to /scripts/actions/merchant.lua, so at least when whatever merch stops working we can know which one.

  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.415^reset;

  -- Items / Armor / Gear--
  * adjusted dreamer set tooltips and armor guide to provide more clarity on shell mechanics (Kherae)
  * moved hazmat set to set_bonuses folder and fixed it up to match code. (Kherae)
  * added wraith armor first prototype  (Kherae)
  * Rewrote various armor descritions for bonuses (Kherae)
  * added Food-Munity Augment. Should allow a character to ignore food penalties.

  -- Stats --

  * deprecated a ton of unused status effects (Kherae)
  * Improved visual flow of Racial descriptions (Kherae)

  -- Dungeons --
  * Adjusted crate loot in the Baron's Keep so the vanilla rewards are always present.
  * Cultist Lair and Cultist Ships have more cultist types to fill them. Cultist types are completely randomized, with 'basic' (pistol-weilding) being the most common, 'scientist' (Machine-pistol weilding ones that throw pets) 2nd most common, 'assault' being third most common, and 'rocket' being the rarest. This should make both the lair and the ship to be far more interesting to encounter. (Rylasasin)
  * Cultist Lairs now have Snipers/Rocket soldiers on top of them guarding them. (Rylasasin)
  * Cultist lair and Cultist ships no longer have triplods. Instead, they have twiguns and cultist scandroids. (Rylasasin)

  -- Techs --

  -- Bugs --
  * Typo corrections (Kukagres)
  * fixed some veluu collar recipes (Kherae)

  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.414^reset;

  -- FRACKIN RACES INTEGRATION --
  * FrackinRaces is now built into FU. There's no reason for it not to be, given that we add 13 races, plus the 7 from the game, and most users also have Elithian Races and Avali installed. (Lucca)
  * The above means, if you have FrackinRaces installed separately it must now be removed. You do not need it anymore.
  * On your ships SAIL, in the MISC section, you will find a new option to enable and disable Race Abilities. Note that some abilities may be hard-coded onto races and not remove (there may be edge cases), but most should disable if desired. These abilities are ON by default. (Lucca)
  * added back-end stats to support swapping race abilities (Lucca)
  * updated cat_primary.lua (Kherae)

  -- Monsters --
  * starspawn series no longer get massive resists from their bubbles, they instead get a shield equal to their health. uptime unchanged (20s duration, 30s cd, so 10s open). Shield strength indicated by opacity. Hit hard or play smart. (Kherae)
  
  -- Combat --
  * Protection (armor) stat values above 100 will now have an effect. The effectiveness of Protection now caps at a stat value of 200. (solardawning)

  -- Missions --
  * left a hint in the mech tutorial's intro radio message about what happens if 'unauthorized user' pops up (Kherae)
  
  -- UI --
  * quest reward related UI panes now expanded to 5 slots (Kherae)

  -- Misc --
  * added 'take all' to centrifuges (Kherae)
  * implemented workaround for starrypy server owners using the message blocker plugin, thus resulting in various effects not functioning. workaround includes tracking data, in case someone decides to grief. (Kherae)

  * applied a regenerating energy shield to serpent droids (Kherae)
  * adjusted food energy regen effects and tooltips, including fixing mint, which was 10x stronger than intended (50% instead of 5%). food energy regen effects are now (effect)/2 for energy regen and half that for energy regen block. IE: haleflower is 30% increased energy regen and 15% reduced energy regen block. (Kherae)

  -- Techs --
  * reworked phase attack. it is no longer reasonably possible to force scientific notation on the char sheet. (Kherae)

  -- Bugs --
  * adjusted blast furnace and arc smelter 'take all' downward (Kherae)
  * fix for RNG weapons erroring during build sequence, due to missing element data (Kherae)
  * corrected energizing augment tooltip not having a % symbol in one line (Kherae)
  * small fix for warpedcapture (Kherae)
  * sanity check fix for electrified.lua (Kherae)
  * Cultist Dungeon now properly spawns (Rylasasin)
  * Welchie should no longer become a Crew Mate, interrupting the tutorial quest flow
  * fixed warp miner and eldritch flesh sets (Kherae)
