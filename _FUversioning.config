______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 5.6.384^reset;

  -- Bees --
  * Complete overhaul of the bee system
  * Mites are no longer a thing, as an item, that you need to worry about. They are a "stat" now. Apiaries no longer spawn them.
  * All frame types stack
  * all frame types have been replaced. The old items still exist, but can no longer be crafted. Toss em. They're worthless now.
  * all bees replaced with new family types with favored biomes, flower types, and loved/hated breeds of bees
  * rival hives will kill off one-anothers drones
  * Drones and Queens stats all have implications on production, lifespan, genetic viability, mutation chances, etc
  * spontaneous mutations can occur that greatly improve queens or drones, resulting in super-bees
  * some bees are sensitive to specific biomes, either producing extra resources or producing no resources...even death if the shift is extreme
  * Bees now have genomes. These genomes dictate a bees stats. The key now is in breeding good queens with good drones to maximize genetic boosts
  * Queens will mate with just about any drone. However, they will only do so once, and will afterwards produce their own drones. The old drones will slowly die
  * Queens have lifespans, and therefore occasionally spawn young queens in the hive. These larval stage queens can be placed in a Queen slot to be matured into adults
  * added Basic Microscope to scan caught wild bee Queens. This will allow you to see her stats, and determine how best to utilize her
  * Anti-Mite frames will reduce chance of contracting mites, and will kill off mites if they are present at a moderate rate. The larger the stack, the greater the effect
  * [test] researching bees in the microscope will generate Research
  * [test] some frame types have a chance to spawn ores, regardless of bee type in the hive
  * all old Bees no longer spawn. In their place, the new bees will. Note that only freshly generated worlds will get the *proper* spread of bee types, but you should still see most of them regardless
  * all old apiaries are automatically converted to the new type.
  * You will need to replace all of your bees with new ones. Trade them in at the Bee Refuge for profit and resources.
  * Scented apiaries removed from crafting and will no longer be used. Scented Frames replace them.
  * balance of this new system is an ongoing task. Please report any feedback about resources, etc.
  
  -- Weapons --
  * Shadow Staff no longer glows (allowing Tenebrhae to utilize it in full)
  
  -- Techs --
  * Distortion Sphere bombs no longer respond to gravity, allowing you to more specifically place them for demolitions/attacks/bombjumps
  * Distortion Sphere bomb detonation times reduced slightly
  * Distortion Sphere bombs now have different sprites that more clearly convey the current state of the projectile
  
  -- Misc --
  * removed test augment 'aaa'. If you had this equipped due to cheat-spawning, remove it or you're going to have issues.
  * removed some log messages from the Fossil script. 
  * corrected some horribly imbalanced stats on the Reinforced Snowpants
  * Large Ship Thruster placement corrected (skies912)
  * fixes a few errors in the Inspired painting loot list (adaxe)

  * coded in two new honey liquids and made the red honey work again. (Sentient Cookie)
  * note that while the new bee changes are not visible to most players yet, the various bee-rewarded Combs have some new names that will confuse you temporarily.
  
  -- Mechs --
  * You can now empty the fuel tanks of your mech, on demand. You will *not* get the fuel within the fuel tank back, however. You can now swap fuels as you need.

  * Spacefarer armor now requires Bio-Thread and Zerchesium to craft, as well as additional protocite. This should make early-access to Gas Giants more challenging.
  * new fully-dyable goggles (Sentient Cookie)
  
  -- Techs --
  * added numerous potential Bonus parameters to FU techs, allowing them to benefit from item, set and racial bonuses where needed.Vanilla techs are (presently) untouched for compatability sake with the many tech mods out there.
  MODDERS: to apply these bonuses to your techs, you can swap from 'multijump.lua' to use 'fumultijump.lua' and similar variants located in our codebase. Use what you need for your scripts as-needed

  * Arc Smelter and Blast Furnace chances to create diamond from ordinary Carbon reduced to 0.5% per carbon in the Blast Furnace, and 2% in the Arc Smelter.
  * Energy Wood trees should be more common, appearing in several additional sub-biomes. This should make finding them somewhat less problematic.
  
  -- Codex --
  * Adding in lore for the Lutrins (KH007)
  * Logging for if the player already knows a codex entry has been removed. Now, only new codexes that either error out or succeed will be logged (this is so that debugging is still possible). (Xan)
  * Additional API has been added to clean up codex entries in the player's storage that no longer exist, though this is unused for the time being. (Xan)

  -- Misc --
  * added additional liquid interactions to numerous tiles. 
  * removed Fog weather from science outpost for those with poorer performance metrics
  * Trade Terminals now inform players that they are destroyed if broken via their tooltips.
