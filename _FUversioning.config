  ^cyan;New in version 6.0.0alpha^reset;
  
  -- The Research Update (at long last!) --
  After four years of planning and biding time, the Research System is finally here. There will most certainly be bumps along the way, but as usual we'll hone it as we go.
  
  - ALL unlocks for crafting are now handled by Researching on the Research Tree. This -includes- vanilla progression. 
  - You can access the Research Tree via your Tricorder, which all new characters begin with. Users with Quickbar installed will be able to use that as well. In addition to this, SAIL has the option in the MISC section.
  - All players now passively gain research at a rate of 1 per 2 seconds.
  - This amount only accrues if you are not AFK.
  - The following new research branches are now available: Electronics, Engineering, Agriculture, Chemistry, Craftsmanship, Geology, Warcraft. You'll find all the recipes within, and will need to manually unlock nodes to learn recipes. This means no more pickup lag from unlocks!
  
  -- Crafting --
  * all 33 Gene items have been removed as resources and replaced with a singular 'Genes' currency. (Kukagres)
  * Gene items can be converted into this new resource at a Xeno Lab. Do it while you still can, as the old Gene items will be gone soon. (Kukagres)

  * research extraction change to research generators (Laptops):
  * basic laptop has a base timer of 2s, this goes down by 0.5 per 'tier' (precursor box is 0.5)
  * research extracted is currently 1% of pixel value per tier, with the precursor box having a bonus: 10% of the research extracted as essence
  * the timer, and extraction values, go up further with rarity (0.25 per tier, starting at 1.0), with essential being equal to legendary at 1.75 (decision due to upgraded weapons). however, if an item has a value of 1 or less research, the value is set to 1 and the timer is multiplied by 0.1
  * Bone armor and Primitive weapons have their own tab in the Bare Hands crafting menu
  * the Ansible is no longer a thing. It is renamed and is a decorative element. It simply wasn't useful or worth the investment.
  * Anvils now only serve a use for other Mods. All anvil content is now available in the Armory.
  * All Sewing Wheel armors relocated to Armory
  * All vanilla racial armors have set bonuses, as do the Silver, Gold, etc sets and the Perfect set.

  -- Madness --
  * Edited Madness Tree: Added Rimworlder clothes to the first node (alongside Autopsy table)
  * renamed Dark Matter Weapons to Dark Matter Gear and added Dark Matter/Wretchel armors to it 
  * Added Drug Diffuser to the second tier of Drug research
  * Added Psionic Harvester to Psionics IV

  -- Automatic Colony System (anoobindisguise) --
  * A Colony Core which collects rent passively from mk2 deeds, and supports 1 of each of 11 addons. The more happiness tenants have from add-ons, the more rent is collected.
  * added Colony Core, Mk2 Deed, Tiny Mk2 Deed
  * Sewage Storage (generates waste from tenants), community library (no power cost, happiness), 
  * Community Garden (growing tray that has speed multiplied by tenants)
  * Hidden Cameras (minus happiness, generates research), 
  * Recycling Center (generates recyclables from tenants), 
  * Computer Lab (requires power, provides happiness)
  * Blood Donation (generates blood and similar stuff from tenants, slight happiness penalty), 
  * Subliminal Messaging (power cost, provides happiness)
  * Drug Diffuser (generates research and madness from tenants, big happiness penalty), 
  * FTL Internet Dish (requires a lot of power, provides a lot of happiness)
  * Psionic Harvester (sprite pending) - generates psionic energy from tenants, requires a ton of power.

  -- BYOS and Ships -- (Hubnester and Skies)
  * Made the ship selection interface more like the FU SAIL interface
  * Removed the wait before selecting which ship you choose (replaced by having to confirm your selection)
  * You can't access ship navigation if you are not on your own ship (unless in admin mode)
  * You can always access ship navigation when in admin mode
  * Reduced the health of sloped rusty panels to match the health of sloped hull panels
  * Added a ship name plate (only the ships owner can name the ship, break the one used to name the ship to reset the name) (Skies)
  * Added the ship name plate to the Ship Crafting node of the engineering research tree
  * Changed it so that techstations check if the world type is unknown instead of if ship.fuel is not nil for checking if on a ship to fix an issue with T0 ships
  * Changed the broken SAIL on the BYOS ship to the BYOS SAIL without a pet
  * Made it so that the ship select interface appears on ships that haven't been replaced with the BYOS ship (though you can only select the vanilla ship)
  * Moved some BYOS related files
  * Big changes to Racializer: 
    - Replaced UI (Skies)
    - Now requires pixels to racialise things (can reduce the price by adding PGIs) (Skies)
    - Takes time to racialise the object (Skies)
    - You can break the old racialiser to get the new one (Skies)
    - You can racialise non-byos ship objects (converts them to the byos version) (Skies)
  * Changed Skath's title in the species file from SKATH to Skath (shouldn't do anything except make it work better with the new racialiser) (Hubnester)
  * Changed the script for the bootship quest (to prevent mods form overriding the changes for BYOS) (Hubnester)
  * Implemented the ability to only travel in the current system better (is currently unused) (Hubnester)
  * Made the NAVIGATION OFFLINE and FTL DRIVE NOT INSTALLED text config parameters in cockpit.config (Hubnester)
  * Ship objects that are racialisable on choosable BYOS ships now get racialised
  * Your ship pet is set to the race you selected, not the race the ship is racialised to
  * You get teleported to your ship teleporter when your chosen ship is placed  
  * NOTE: starter treasure in choosable BYOS ship could be in any container with enough space for it that isn't a fuel hatch

  -- Melee --
  * corrected improperly done math which would have resulted in incorrect scaling of mastery bonuses. (Kherae)
  * moved mastery variable loading in update block to mastery section (Kherae)
  * damage/kill combo code for daggers or longswords revised: bonuses now scale with masteries of equipped weapons, rather than just longsword. (Kherae)
  * added shortswordbonus and daggerbonus clears to clear function (Kherae)
  
  -- Mechs --
  * Mech init no longer gives the player a free mech (anoobindisguise)
  * mech fuel UI no longer truncates current fuel values (Kherae)
  * cat themed fuel is usable again for refueling mech. (Kherae)
  * mech fuel system now supports going over the maximum by the value of one fuel item. IE: cat fuel at max-1 will become catfuel + max-1. Words are tricky. In short: fuel is never wasted. (Kherae)
  * Mech Bodise now have descriptive text for their resistances (anoobindisguise)
  * Adjusted mech progression a bit so that the titanium bodies in particular are not as omni-resistant (anoobindisguise)
  * Mech Mining Lasers have had their damage rebalanced

  -- Missions --
  * Made a small adjustment on the Hylotl dungeon to make the bottom part slightly easier. (rylasasin)

  -- Misc --
  * Vastly improved and expanded on the FU Guide codexes to give updated information and control/mechanic data.
  * weapons clamped to max size, and ammo bar as well (Kherae)
  * revised necrontir set pixel values (Kherae)
  * updated codex entry for dark commander set bonus (Kherae)
  * all RNG firearms have a wider range of possible values, resulting in a more even spread. This will make crafted weapons almost -always- the preferable option, apart from the odd uber-RNG weapon.
  * Microscope UI is now more easily worked with, with defined slots for outputs.
  * Solar Panels of all tiers are no longer nerfed on Ships or Space Stations due to the Research method being implemented! Rejoice!

  * Space Diver Armor (Sprite improvements pending). (anoobindisguise)
  * Added a tag to randomharpoongun to make it buffed by space diver armor. (anoobindisguise)
  * Sloped Rusty/Scrap panels (anoobindisguise)
  * the Wiring station is now available at the first Inventor Table upgrade, and needs titanium, rather than later on and requiring Durasteel. There are far too many useful devices to gate it that late.
  * added Rock Crusher. Requires 6W power. Acts as a mid-tier sifter, but can process rocky materials rather than sandy ones. (anoobindisguise)
  * craftable beer liquid
  * apple juice and grape juice use the vanilla crafting method again (anoobindisguise)

  * Booster set is clothing/sewing only.
  * necrontir minor revision: removed 25% hp from weapon bonus. armor bonus now gives Undying Resolve, increasing Defense by up to 30% as health gets lower. (Kherae)

  * Gave the grown thrown items some value, so you don't get them for free with EES (rylasasin)
  * Expanded EES List. (rylasasin)
  * Gave coordinator.stagehand.patch entries for ALL FU items so NPCs can use weapons efficiently.  (rylasasin)
  * Gave some (but not all) of the FU food items FR herb/carni effects. Long overdue. (rylasasin)

  * fixed crystal block unlock (CyanSkyKnight)
  * added new Data Server icon (anoobindisguise)

  * Wooden Cooking Table craftable at tier1 Inventor's Table (anoobindisguise)
  * Conglomerate is now siftable. (anoobindisguise)
