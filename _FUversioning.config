  (sayter, Kherae, anoobindisguise, kukagres, Pixelflame, Hubnester, edwardspec)

  -- Research --
  * Moved Triangle Jump to the correct node
  * Removed duplicate entries from the Bizarre Cooking node
  * Pet Station is now a tier2 craftable, and relocated to earlier in the Husbandry nodes
  * Made Electronics Center iron-tier. 
  * Electronics tree no longer references the Tinkering Table. Added adv circuit req to combustion. Lowered a few overly-high mat costs (such as 50 oil for combustion)
  * Got rid of the ff_plastic req for basic module research because about half the starting EPPs can be made with exclusively tier 1 materials 
  * Dash 1, Dash 2, Microsphere no longer show up as default unlocks in tech crafting


  -- Misc --
  * Hiring Office now has descriptions
  * Renamed the Reinforced Glass tile type to Reinforced Glass Block to avoid confusion with the crafting resource
  * STL drive now has a price so it can be sold once rendered irrelevant
  * Liquid Mixer uses 15W instead of 20W of power
  * Core Rifle reworked to function as an overheating weapon. Can fire 5 shots (2 seconds of firing) before overheating. DPS is about 10-15% better than an iron assault rifle during that time. Redid the sprite a bit too.
  * Made core pack require plastic polymer instead of woven fabric.
  * Fixed Flesh Strand, Bio Sample default unlocks.
  * Craftable Copper, Silver and Gold armor sets.
  * Added Rock Breaker, the weaker version of the Rock Crusher and the counterpart to the wooden sifter. Gave it a tutorial quest too!
  * Adjusted greenhouse recipe requirements
  * Fluffalo, Mooshi, Hen eggs available at random merchants.
  * Random merchants no longer sell Graphene - too easy to mass-produce by turning ~100 pixels into a unit, messed with tree progression, and was a bit too high-tech for random joe salesman to have access to.
  * Slew/Feed 2 and 3 additives swapped - Feed 2 now needs sugar, Feed 3 now needs gene stuff. Sugar is more or less, easier to get than genes, so it should come first.
  * Carnivore Slew can be made with boneboo as an alternative to meat.
  * Drastically increased base DPS of the Mercy primary fire, and the weapon is now properly marked as Legendary
  
  -- Missions --
  * Completing the Dark Caverns now checks for the Ancient Device at the final gate, rather than the Tricorder.
  * Added prereq “create_electronics” to “fuquest_powergeneration1” and “fuquest_powergeneration2”.

  -- Bugs --
  * Fixed FF_Carbon PGI error (obsidian, penumbral dirt/stone, etc)
  * Fixes an issue with Pet Houses potentially resetting ships
  * You can no longer easily farm Protheon from the Lost and Found
  * Longsword + Shield should properly function for Left-Handed characters
  * Longsword Dual Wielding should properly function
  * Iron Mace appears in the correct tab
  * Hellfire Ejector appears in the Rocket tab as it should

______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 6.0.133 ^reset;

  -- Research --
  * Adjusted various node prices
  * Corrected typos
  * Old Wood now appears in the Craftsmanship tree
  * Mantizi gear added to the Craftsmanship tree

  -- BYOS --
  * Added a few alternate appearances for the Pet House (currently not able to access them legitimately)
  * if a SAIL doesn't have ship pet set it doesn't spawn one instead of defaulting to petweasel
  * Added petweasel as the ship pet to the Science SAIL to fix not being able to configure the ship pet since it isn't set
  * Hopefully fixed a potential issue with the racialiser and objects with absolute paths for their images (haven't tested if the fix works)

  -- Misc --
  * adjusted Reinforced Glass to use an updated recipe. It should be with Glass in your Furnace
  * Plasma Cores appear properly in the Matter Assembler

______________________________________________
  ^cyan;New in version 6.0.132 ^reset;

  -- BYOS --
  *  you can change some stuff about your Ship Pet from one of the Options in the [MISC] section of the SAIL menu (e.g. if you you interact with it or not)

  -- Reseach --
  * Gold Circuitry node requires less resources
  * Item Utilities node requires less resources and Research (1000 -> 800)
  * Graphene node in Chemistry reduced from 2700 to 2000 Research
  * Morphite reduced from 7200 to 5000 Research
  * Drastically reduced many Armor and Weapons node costs

  -- Madness --
  * minor adjustments to madness quest script:
   - 'food' drain event removes and may randomly reapply well-fed bonus. food randomizer instead randomizes energy on casual. This makes them more relevant for casual players.
   - replaced application of medical station toxic cloud with a madness specific variant. additionally, added a minor slow and a beans related message.
   - replaced usage of staffslow2 and slow with madness specific slows of reduced effectiveness. staffslow2 could be cheesed using heavy weapons anyway.
   - corrected flipped conditions in research bonus by tier, resulting in a bonus never applying for staying more than 25 minutes on a high tier planet.
   - max food reduction effect instead applies the gas cloud and slow effects for casual players.
   - added an alarming radio message when vulnerability is applied.
   - added a harmless message to the >1500 bracket, purely to confuse people further.
  * Crown of the Idiot: now applies a stacking healingBonus modifier of -0.5 per interval, stacking up to -2.0 (effectively negating any and all healingBonus increases), to mitigate AFK cheese by making the target decidedly...mortal.

  -- Misc --
  * Combustion Generator now uses Advanced Processor, rather than Advanced Circuit, in its recipe
  * Made chainsaw cool
  * Rock Crusher processes more stone types

  -- Bugs --
  * tutorial quest: moved setStage(1) from init to questStart, to prevent quest restarting on leaving worlds etc.
  * Fixed colony stuff crashing due to unexpected reactions to Khe's transferutil changes. Added sanity checks.
  * Doom Trees no longer drop Research
  * dozens of minor corrections and fixes
  * Corrected Protheon output from the Protheon Shard via microscopes

	"welcome" : "
Frackin' Universe has introduced a new ^orange;Research System^reset; as of version 6.0.0 (October, 2020). 

This change completely revamps game progression from the ground up, letting users choose what they want to learn, and when, at their own pace. It also brings with it a slowed down early-game and a more trackable progression chain from mid-game and onward.
You will be required to interact directly with the ^orange;Research System^reset; to do this, however.

To access the ^orange;Research System^reset; menu, the following are options:

- Your ^orange;Personal Tricorder^reset;, via the ^green;Green Beaker^reset; icon. This is the most immediate method, and is available as soon as you start your ships computer.\n
- Via your ^orange;SAIL^reset; on your ship, in the ^green;MISC^reset; menu.\n
- Via the ^orange;Quickbar^reset;, if you use that mod. We highly recommend it.\n

^cyan;Read the Guide books in your ships storage^reset; for more detailed help about game mechanics and features.

NOTE: ^red;You should no longer have Frackin Races^reset; installed if using Frackin Universe. This will cause problems.

^orange;If using BYOS mode with custom races^reset;: you must install the addon located on Steam/CF Forums (FU BYOS Race Addon).
^orange;If using Custom Races with FU SAIL^reset;: Install theaddon via Steam or CF Forums (FU SAIL Modded Race Support).

You can open this window manually if you have the StardustLib or QuickBar mod installed via the !Updates button.
Please make sure you are not using anything included in the RED (and ideally the other colors too) on the Info tab below.
